*Real-Time Black Hole Ray Tracing Simulation Using OpenGL
Oct 2023 - today
Studied and analyzed an existing black hole ray tracing simulation implemented using OpenGL.
Key Responsibilities: 1. Analyzed the existing codebase and algorithms of the OpenGL black hole ray
tracing simulation. 2. Explored the effects of a simpliffed geodesic equation on light bending near black
holes. 3. Initiating the enhancement of the simulation’s accuracy by proposing and working towards
implementing an advanced geodesic equation.

*Ray Tracing Model Extension
April 2022 - July 2022
· Extended the ”Ray Tracing in One Weekend” project to include additional ray tracing features, significantly
 enhancing the realism and complexity of the rendered scenes.
Key Responsibilities: 1. Incorporated BRDF models for more accurate simulation of light-material
interactions. 2. Implemented a BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) to optimize the rendering process,
reducing computation time while maintaining high-quality output.
