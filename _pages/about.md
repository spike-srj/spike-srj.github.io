I am a recent graduate in astrophysics, currently working as a graphics algorithm engineer while preparing to apply for PhD programs. My academic interests lie in connecting theoretical predictions with observational data, particularly in the context of extreme gravitational environments.

## Research Interests

I am exploring how computational methods can bridge the gap between theory and observations in astrophysics:

**Computational Astrophysics & Black Hole Physics**  
Learning how theoretical models of black holes can be tested against observational data through computational approaches. I'm particularly interested in developing ray-marching algorithms to visualize gravitational lensing, photon trajectories, and accretion processes. This work combines general relativistic calculations with real-time rendering techniques to create both scientifically accurate and intuitive representations of extreme gravitational environments.

**Hierarchical Structure in Astrophysical Systems**  
My work on giant molecular clouds has sparked a broader interest in understanding hierarchical structures across cosmic scales. I'm fascinated by how self-gravity and turbulence shape structures from sub-parsec to galactic scales, and how computational algorithms like dendrograms can reveal these multi-scale relationships in observational data.

**AGN Feedback and Host Galaxy Evolution**  
Studying the observational signatures of supermassive black hole feedback in active galactic nuclei, particularly how outflows and accretion processes influence star formation in host galaxies. I'm interested in using spectroscopic data to probe the co-evolution between central black holes and their galactic environments.

## Current Activities

I currently work as a Graphics Algorithm Engineer at iMotion Inc., where I'm developing my skills in computational graphics and real-time rendering. This experience has been valuable for my research interests, as many of the techniques translate well to astrophysical visualization problems.

In my spare time, I'm working on personal projects involving black hole ray-tracing simulations, which help me better understand both the physics and the computational challenges involved.

## Background & Future Plans

**Education:**  
M.Phil. Astrophysics, University of Science and Technology of China (2020-2023)  
B.Sc. Space Science and Technology, Hebei Normal University (2015-2019)

I am currently preparing applications for PhD programs where I hope to further develop my research skills and contribute to our understanding of black hole physics and computational astrophysics.
