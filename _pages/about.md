With a robust foundation in mathematics and physics, I possess an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of light radiation. My practical experiences extend to data processing and graphical rendering, showcasing a blend of theoretical knowledge and real-world application.

I am deeply passionate about self-learning, especially in the field of graphics. My particular interest lies in using ray-tracing techniques to simulate celestial phenomena like black holes. This interest is bolstered by my proficiency in reading English literature, a skill developed through consistent engagement with academic texts.

Photography, one of my hobbies, reflects my keen aesthetic sense. I have applied this passion professionally as a photographer at the "Star-Gazing" summer camp, capturing the night sky and more.

Teamwork is another cornerstone of my approach. I served as the president of the Tai Chi Club, leading it to earn the title of one of the top ten clubs. During my university years, I also collaborated with the Astronomy Club to organize multiple public outreach activities in astronomy, further combining my leadership skills and scientific interests.

This blend of analytical acumen, creative expression, and leadership experience defines my personal and professional identity, driving me to continually explore and contribute to the fields of science and technology.
