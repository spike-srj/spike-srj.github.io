I am deeply passionate about self-learning, especially in the field of graphics. My particular interest lies in using ray-tracing techniques to simulate celestial phenomena like black holes. This interest is bolstered by my proficiency in reading English literature, a skill developed through consistent engagement with academic texts.

# Hierarchical Structure and Self-gravity in the Maddalena Giant Molecular Cloud
  Date: Dec 2021 - July 2024, Apj, accepted for publication.  
  Employed a modiffed Dendrogram algorithm to decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the Maddalena
 giant molecular cloud into hierarchical substructures, and investigated the inffuence of selfgravity
 on different spatial scales.


# Does Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes Coevolve with the Host in Type 2 Quasars?
  Date: Dec 2017 - July 2019, Apj, 2023, 950 16.  
  Revealed how the activity of supermassive black holes inffuences star formation and evolution in their host galaxies by studying material outffows in Type 2 quasars.
