# Real-Time Black Hole Ray Tracing Simulation Using OpenGL

Oct 2023 - today  
Studied and analyzed an existing black hole ray tracing simulation implemented using OpenGL.  
Key Responsibilities:  
1. Analyzed the existing codebase and algorithms of the OpenGL black hole ray tracing simulation. 
2. Explored the effects of a simpliffed geodesic equation on light bending near black holes. 
3. Initiating the enhancement of the simulation’s accuracy by proposing and working towards implementing an advanced geodesic equation.

# Ray Tracing Model Extension

April 2022 - July 2022  
Extended the ”Ray Tracing in One Weekend” project to include additional ray tracing features, significantly enhancing the realism and complexity of the rendered scenes.  
Key Responsibilities:  
1. Incorporated BRDF models for more accurate simulation of light-material interactions. 
2. Implemented a BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) to optimize the rendering process,reducing computation time while maintaining high-quality output.
