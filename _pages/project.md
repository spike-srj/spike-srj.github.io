# Real-Time Black Hole Ray Tracing Simulation Using OpenGL

Oct 2023 - today  

Developed an advanced real-time black hole visualization system that accurately simulates photon trajectories around massive gravitational bodies, creating physically-based renders of black hole phenomena including gravitational lensing, photon spheres, and event horizons.

Key Responsibilities:  
1. Engineered a real-time C++/GLSL simulation to model photon trajectories and gravitational lensing
phenomena in Schwarzschild spacetime, employing fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration.
2. Systematically addressed and resolved numerical instabilities in the ray tracing algorithm that led to
visual artifacts under specific geometric conditions, ensuring physically consistent depictions of light
deflection.
3. Implemented robust numerical techniques for handling radial turning points and integrating conserved
quantities (e.g., signed angular momentum) to accurately simulate a range of photon orbits and their
ultimate fates (escape or capture).
4. Deepened expertise in applying general relativity to computational astrophysics, with a keen interest
in extending these methods to explore more complex scenarios such as rotating black holes or the
dynamics of matter and radiation in extreme gravitational environments.

# Ray Tracing Model Extension

April 2022 - July 2022  

Extended the ”Ray Tracing in One Weekend” project to include additional ray tracing features, significantly enhancing the realism and complexity of the rendered scenes.  

Key Responsibilities:  
1. Incorporated BRDF models for more accurate simulation of light-material interactions. 
2. Implemented a BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) to optimize the rendering process,reducing computation time while maintaining high-quality output.
