May 2024	Hierarchical Structure and Self-gravity in the Maddalena Giant Molecular Cloud	The Astrophysical Journal	In this work, we present the data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project for the Maddalena giant molecular cloud (GMC). We decompose the 13CO emission datacube of the observed region into hierarchical substructures using a modified Dendrogram algorithm. We investigate the statistical properties of these substructures and examine the role that self-gravity plays on various spatial scales. The statistics of the mass (M), radius (R), velocity dispersion (σv), virial parameter (αvir), and sonic Mach number of the substructures are presented. The radius and mass distributions and the σv-R scaling relationship of the substructures resemble those reported in previous studies that use non-hierarchical algorithms to identify the entities. We find that for the hierarchical substructures αvir decreases as the radius or mass of the substructures increases. The majority of the substructures in the quiescent region of Maddalena GMC are not gravitationally bound (αvir > 2), while most of the substructures in the star-forming regions are gravitationally bound (αvir < 2). Furthermore, we find that self-gravity plays an important role on scales of 0.8-4 pc in the IRAS 06453 star-forming region, while it is not an important factor on scales below 5 pc in the non-star-forming region.

June 2023	Does Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes Coevolve with the Host in Type 2 Quasars?	The Astrophysical Journal	The feedback from the accretion of central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is a hot topic in the coevolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. By tracing the large-scale outﬂow using the line proﬁle and bulk velocity shift of [O III]λ5007, the evolutionary role of outﬂow is studied here on a large sample of 221 type 2 quasars (QSO2s) extracted from Reyes et al. By following our previous study on local Seyfert 2 galaxies, the current spectral analysis on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic database enables us to arrive at the following results: (1) by using the Lick indices, we conﬁrm that QSO2s are, on average, more frequently associated with younger stellar populations than Seyfert galaxies; (2) QSO2s with a stronger outﬂow tend to be associated with a younger stellar population, which implies a coevolution between the feedback from SMBHs and the host in QSO2s; (3) although occupied at the high Lbol/LEdd end, the QSO2s follow the Lbol/LEdd-Dn(4000) sequence established from local, less-luminous Seyfert galaxies, which suggests a decrease of the accretion activity of SMBHs and also of feedback as the circumnuclear stellar population continuously ages.
